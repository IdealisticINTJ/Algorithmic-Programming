# CPP

Collection of various algorithms, codes and solutions to questions in mathematics, machine learning, computer science, statistics, etc. implemented in C/Java/Python for educational purposes.
## Overview

I use this repository to store the solutions of problems which I solve from various online judges.I primarily use JAVA & C to solve the problems.
The algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc.. The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.
