# Competitive-Programming-Resources Library :dart:

Collection of various algorithms, codes and solutions to questions in mathematics, machine learning, computer science, statistics, etc. implemented in C/Java/Python for educational purposes.
## Overview <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

I will be using this repository to store the solutions of problems which I solve from various online judges. I primarily use JAVA & C to solve the problems.
The algorithms (will) span a variety of topics from computer science, linear algebra, mathematics and statistics, data science, machine learning etc.
The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource. 
Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.
